##My coding practices

###[MyJava/src/general](https://github.com/humpydonkey/Portfolio/tree/master/MyJava/src/general)
To deepen my understanding of Computer Science, I implemented most of the fundamental [data structures](https://github.com/humpydonkey/Portfolio/tree/master/MyJava/src/general/datastructure) and [algorithms](https://github.com/humpydonkey/Portfolio/tree/master/MyJava/src/general/algorithms) from the this book [Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) and its corresponding course.
Moreover, it contains some simple programs of a technology that I found interesting and wanted to learn.

###[MyJava/src/interview](https://github.com/humpydonkey/Portfolio/tree/master/MyJava/src/interview)
To improve my coding skills, I did a little practices on a few websites ([codility](https://codility.com/programmers/), [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), ...) and a few books([Cracking the Coding Interview 150](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098478280X/), [Elements of Programming Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836), besides I recorded some interesting coding quesitons I've seen from several forums.
