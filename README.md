##My coding practices

###MyJava/src/general
To deepen my understanding of Computer Science, I implemented most of the fundamental data structures and algorithms from the this book Algorithms, 4th Edition[http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/] and its corresponding course.
Moreover, it contains some simple programs of a technology that I found interesting and wanted to learn.

###MyJava/src/interview
To improve my coding skills, I did a little practices on a few websites (codility[https://codility.com/programmers/], leetcode[https://leetcode.com/], ...) and a few Books(Cracking the Coding Interview 150[http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431618535&sr=1-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview], Elements of Programming Interview[http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431618607&sr=8-1&keywords=Elements+of+Programming+Interviews]), besides I recorded some interesting coding quesitons I've seen from several forums.
