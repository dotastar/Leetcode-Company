##My coding practices

###MyJava/src/general
To deepen my understanding of Computer Science, I implemented most of the fundamental data structures and algorithms from the this book [Algorithms, 4th Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) and its corresponding course.
Moreover, it contains some simple programs of a technology that I found interesting and wanted to learn.

###MyJava/src/interview
To improve my coding skills, I did a little practices on a few websites ([codility](https://codility.com/programmers/), [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), ...) and a few Books(Cracking the Coding Interview 150, Elements of Programming Interview), besides I recorded some interesting coding quesitons I've seen from several forums.

###MyJava/src/machine_learning
My coding practices of my machine learning course.
